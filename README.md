## Bugs, Problems

Along my journey making the project, I ran into a profound amount of issues and bugs, a lot of which broke the project entirely - nothing a quick CTRL+Z cannot fix, though.

There is a vibrant history of these issues recorded on my github, as one thing I made sure to do on this project was commit and push changes as regularly as possible, commenting appropriately.

One of the biggest issues I ran into was having to cut back on the layout of my pages. Originally, I had wanted to do different designs for each of the main pages (Home, Meet, Games, About), though I found that there was a bit too much deviance from order. I decided to go back to the format of the first Home page, and continue with this throughout. I believed this to be a more organic experience for the user, as they would be able to expect on other pages what they found conventional from their starting point.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to my tutor, Caleb, my girlfriend, Grace and my brothers, Garrett and Colin, all of whom gave incredible support and guidance throughout the creation of Bored Gamers. 

Also, thank you to the fine lecturers of Code Institute, and the ever-growing community on Slack!

I very much look forward to taking what I've learned on this project and applying it to future endeavours. The best way to learn is to err, and this pragmatic approach to learning had me thinking of how to improve things at every corner.
