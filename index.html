                <p>Board games are a great way to spend time with friends and family. We are living in an increasingly isolating world, so 
                    sometimes it's good to put the phone down and pick the dice up. If you're finding that your phone or keyboard is stuck too firmly in your grasp, fear not! One of
                    the incredible byproducts of modern technology is that it can bring us together when we're apart. With a multitude of gaming options at our fingertips,
                     we can log on to create and share those enjoyable moments with friends and family - wherever you are.
